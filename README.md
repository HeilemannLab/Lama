Lama: The LocAlization Microscopy Analyzer

We introduce the LocAlization Microscopy Analyzer (LAMA), a software tool that contains several well-established data post processing algorithms for single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data. LAMA has implemented algorithms for cluster analysis, colocalization analysis, localization precision estimation and image registration. LAMA works with a graphical user interface (GUI), and accepts simple input data formats as supported by various single- molecule localization software tools.

Availability and implementation: LAMA is written in Python and published open source under GNU publishing license (GPL) version 3 or later.
